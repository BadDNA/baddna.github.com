# We need to now install the packages for QIIME2
# Using Nano or a code editor,  copy and paste/download the code from the file label "Dockerfile" into a new file called Dockerfile

# Once you have the Dockerfile created, run this line to 
docker build -t my-r-image .

# This will take some time, so grab a coffe, go outside, and get some fresh air. There is another option!
# Currently there exist an image and this is much faster to install
# Pull Docker image 
docker pull gbrodri/my-r-image:WorkingModel

#To run the container
docker run -dp 8787:8787 my-r-image
# Your username and password will both be rstudio
